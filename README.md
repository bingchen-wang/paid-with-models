    Optimal contract designs for multi-type scenarios. <br>

## Additional Experiments
In addition to the experiments presented in the paper, we provide two additional experiments in the repository for interested readers.


### Constraint Simplication: Speed-up effect?
The contribution of constraint analysis in the paper comes in two fronts. First, it helps establish clean properties of the optimal contract. Second, it may help speed up computation (~15% for Sec. 6.2.).  However, the effect depends significantly on the choice of optimization algorithmâ€”it is expected to be more pronounced for active-set methods [1] and likely to matter less so for others.

> The scripts [ðŸ“œ Experiment_Twotype_Case.ipynb](Experiment_Twotype_Case.ipynb) and [ðŸ“œ Experiment_Multitype_Case_noSimp.ipynb](Experiment_Multitype_Case_noSimp.ipynb) run through the experiments in Sec. 6.1 and Sec. 6.2 without the constraint simplication.

### Scalability: Running-time increase with $N$ and $I$.
Our preliminary experiments show that the algorithmâ€™s running time increases at roughly a factor of 2 per additional type added, while increments in $N$ has less effect. This corroborates our discussion on the combinatorial challenge in Appendix B.9. Our current model is best suited for cases where $N$ and $I$ are reasonably finite, as is the case of cross-silos collaboration.  For reference, it took 8.03 seconds (wall-clock) to run the experiments in Sec 6.2 on a Macbook Pro with M2 chip. We posit that scalability can be improved with relaxation on the distribution assumption, which is an active research area [2]. It can also be improved with better approximation algorithms, though with a trade-off between welfare and speed of computation.

> Interested reader can implement [ðŸ“œ Scalability_check_increasing_N.py](Scalability_check_increasing_N.py) and [ðŸ“œ Scalability_check_increasing_types.py](Scalability_check_increasing_types.py) to see the increase in running time.
